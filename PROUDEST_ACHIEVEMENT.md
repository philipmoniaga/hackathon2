My proudest achievement was create ads platform in Carousell because it was one of the biggest revenue source for Carousell. 
Briefly Carousell is series D startup in Singapore marketplace C2C.
I got tasked to create external ads platform to connect with multiple supply ads and put in the right position to increase our revenue.
Briefly the problem to be solved is how to ensure our customer see the ads in the correct position so the ads will get higher chance to be clicked and not seeing same ads with same supply ads.
In addition the problem, some country for example like Indonesia and Malaysia if we put too many ads it will decrease our growth.
I designed and code the system to experiment A/B testing for the position roughly around 100 position because Carousel layout its like pinterest so every block spot and pagination has success factor to the ads.
Another interesting thing is how to save multiple ads or track click in different position and ads so we not show the same ads to the same customer because we launch in multiple country and different country has different behaviour for the positioning ads.
In term of technology I learn alot choosing right database, cache and conccurency because I must track every customer click also and we do event tracking for every position and many other stuffs.
It really challenging and make me happy also because it directly impact to revenue in the company and make increase around 30-40% revenue itself.
